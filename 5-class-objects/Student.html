CONSTRUCTORS:

Constructor can only assign the values(this.name = name)
It cannot return anything.
If suppose the type of name is string then it cannot return a error message.
Hence we create a factory method inside the class that can validate all the things.
This factory method(newStudent) is of static type as it is not dependent on the constructor for anything
(ie we are not using this keyword anywhere)
